# CornerCat
Puts a cat in the corner of a react webpage

#Credits:
Cat images are not mine, they are a free asset which can be found "https://craftpix.net/freebies/free-street-animal-pixel-art-asset-pack/"

#What it does:
Places a cat on a small platform in the bottom right corner of a webpage. It will run left and right based on the scroll.
It also dynamically changes size based on window size. Finally, there is actually two cats, with a 90% chance of having one over the other.


#How to use:
Inside the function you want to use just create a Cat object, by using "<Cat />"

#Change Animations:
Make sure to adjust the frame width and number of frames for each animation. Additionally changing the images is as easy as replacing the ones inside the cat folder. Size can be adjusted within the "getResponsiveScale()" function
